# Python Projects Portfolio

A collection of Python projects demonstrating spatial analysis, GIS automation, and algorithmic problem-solving. These projects showcase technical implementation and spatial reasoning with a focus on functionality over visual design.

##  Repository Structure

### Algorithms
- **KD-tree implementation** for efficient spatial search operations
- **Spatial indexing** using recursive data structures
- **Geographic calculations** including centroid determination and area computation

### GIS_Python
- **Proportional symbol mapping** for thematic cartography
- **Accessibility analysis** workflows for spatial decision-making
- **Geospatial data handling** with GeoJSON and shapefiles
- **Hammer equal-area projection** implementation for global mapping

### Arcpy
- **GIS automation scripts** using ArcPy for spatial data processing and workflow optimization

### Practice
- **Blowing figures visualization** – interactive particle simulation
- **Console-based Wordle** – text-based word game implementation

##  Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Matplotlib
- ArcPy
- Custom spatial algorithms and geometry libraries

##  Setup Notes

Some notebooks were developed in Google Colab. When running locally, you may need to:
- Adjust file paths to match your directory structure
- Install required dependencies: `pip install matplotlib arcpy`
- Ensure ArcGIS Pro is installed for ArcPy functionality
